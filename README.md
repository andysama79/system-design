## What are Design Patterns? | Introduction to Design Patterns and Principles

- Design patterns are a way of thinking that helps solve common problems in software development. They provide a description or template to follow, a series of formalized best practices, steps that programmers have followed and used to solve ocmmon problems.

### Type of Design Patters

#### Creational Patterns

- Deal with the creation of objects
- Provide more flexibility in how the objects are actually created
- Examples:
  - Builder Pattern: allows for the step-by-step creation of objects
  - Factory Method Pattern: provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be  created.

#### Structural Patterns

- Deal with how classes are actually designed
- Provide extra functionality using inheritance, composition, and aggregation
- Examples:
  - Flyweight Pattern: allows for the sharing of data between similar objects
  - Adapter Pattern: allows for adaptationof an interface to match the interface of a class that is not compatible

#### Behavioral Patterns

- Specifically concerned with communication and assignment of responsibilities between objects as the program is running
- Examples:
  - Strategy Pattern: allows for the selection of a strategy from a family of strategies
  - Mememto Pattern: allows for the saving and restoring of the state of an object
