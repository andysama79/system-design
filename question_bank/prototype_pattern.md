## EXTRACTED MAIN POINTS

* The Builder design pattern allows for the creation of complex objects from a step-by-step process.
* It separates object construction from its own class and moves it to a separate object called a builder.
* The pattern is a creational design pattern that deals with object creation mechanisms.
* It provides a solution to the problem of traditional constructors, which can lead to code duplication and complexity.
* The Builder Pattern is used in conjunction with the Director Pattern, which encapsulates various ways to construct a product using the same builder object.
* The Director Pattern allows for reusing construction code across multiple objects and enables flexibility in dealing with different builder implementations.
* The Builder Pattern can be applied to create complex objects with various attributes, such as a Car object with brand, model, color, and doors.
