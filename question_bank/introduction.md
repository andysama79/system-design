# Introduction

1. Design patterns are a set of formalized best practices for solving common problems in software development.
2. Design patterns are a way of thinking that helps solve problems in software development.
3. There are three groups of design patterns: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.
4. Creational Patterns deal with object creation, providing flexibility in how objects are created.
5. Structural Patterns deal with class design, using inheritance, composition, and aggregation to provide extra functionality.
6. Behavioral Patterns specifically concern communication and assignment of responsibilities between objects as the program is running.
7. Examples of design patterns include Builder, Flyweight, Strategy, and Memento.
