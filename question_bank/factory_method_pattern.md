# Factory Method Pattern

* The Simple Factory Idiom is a creational design pattern that encapsulates the creation logic of a product in a separate class.
* The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that loosens the coupling of a given code by separating the product's construction code from the code that uses this product.
* The Factory Method Pattern relies heavily on inheritance, delegating object creation to subclasses that implement the factory method.
* The Factory Method Pattern makes it easy to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the application, allowing new types of products to be introduced without breaking existing client code.
* The Factory Method Pattern should be used when there is no idea beforehand of the exact types and dependencies of the objects the code will work with.
* The Factory Method Design Pattern loosens the coupling of a given code by separating the product's construction code from the code that uses this product.
