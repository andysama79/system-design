# Singleton Pattern

* **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides a single point of access to it.
* **Global Variables**: Represent a global point of access used to reference an object from anywhere in an application.
* **Private Static Field**: Stores the singleton instance and is accessible only within the class.
* **Constructor**: A method used to create an object based on the class, with access level set to private.
* **getInstance() Method**: A public static method that returns the singleton instance.
* **Synchronized Block**: Ensures only one thread can execute it at a time.
* **Double-Checked Locking Idiom**: A technique used to improve performance by limiting synchronization to the rare case of computing the field's value.
* **Volatile Fields**: Ensures multiple threads can handle the singleton instance correctly.

| What is the main benefit of using the Singleton Pattern? | To ensure a single instance of a class exists and provides a single point of access to it. |
| How does the Singleton Pattern handle multi-threaded environments? | It requires special treatment to handle multiple threads. |
| What is the purpose of the Singleton Pattern in real-world scenarios? | To provide a single instance of a class that can be accessed globally. |
| What is the trade-off of using the Singleton Pattern? | It can be difficult to test and debug due to its global nature. |
