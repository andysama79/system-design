**Extracted Main Points**

* The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects.
* It separates construction code from the object itself.
* The Builder pattern enables the creation of complex objects through a step-by-step process, allowing for flexibility and reuse of construction code.
* A Director class can be used to create multiple objects using a Builder class.
* The Director class encapsulates the construction process and can be used with different builders.
* Complex objects have many attributes and require a step-by-step construction process.
* Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, such as constructors and factories.
