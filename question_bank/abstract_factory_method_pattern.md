# Abstract Factory Method Pattern

1. The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
2. It is used to decouple the creation of products from the part that is actually using them.
3. The Factory Method Pattern is not enough when it comes to creating multiple distinct products.
4. The Abstract Factory Pattern follows the open-closed principle and the single responsibility principle.
5. It is used in a practical example to simulate the creation of computer parts, specifically GPUs and monitors.

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What is the Abstract Factory Pattern? | A creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. |
| What is the main purpose of the Abstract Factory Pattern? | To decouple the creation of products from the part that is actually using them. |
| What is the difference between the Factory Method Pattern and the Abstract Factory Pattern? | The Factory Method Pattern is not enough when it comes to creating multiple distinct products, while the Abstract Factory Pattern can create families of related objects. |
| What is the benefit of using the Abstract Factory Pattern? | It follows the open-closed principle and the single responsibility principle. |
| How does the Abstract Factory Pattern follow the open-closed principle and the single responsibility principle? | It allows for extension without modification and ensures that each class has only one reason to change. |
| What is an example of using the Abstract Factory Pattern in a real-world scenario? | Simulating the creation of computer parts, specifically GPUs and monitors. |
| What is the main advantage of using the Abstract Factory Pattern over the Factory Method Pattern? | It can create families of related objects, while the Factory Method Pattern is limited to creating single objects. |
| What is the relationship between the Abstract Factory Pattern and the single responsibility principle? | The Abstract Factory Pattern ensures that each class has only one reason to change, following the single responsibility principle. |
